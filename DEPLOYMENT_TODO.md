# Deployment Status

## âœ… Completed

### Infrastructure Setup
- âœ… nginx reverse proxy configured
- âœ… Docker containerization implemented  
- âœ… IPFS full DHT node running
- âœ… Unstoppable Domains (.brave) configured
- âœ… SSL/TLS ready (nginx configuration)
- âœ… Firewall configured (UFW)

### Development Workflow
- âœ… Vite build system optimized
- âœ… React Router HashRouter for IPFS
- âœ… IPFS static export working
- âœ… Docker automated rebuilds
- âœ… Unified deployment script (`npm run publish:all`)

### Documentation
- âœ… Comprehensive TECH_STACK.md
- âœ… IPFS UX solution documented
- âœ… README.md created
- âœ… Deprecated scripts organized

## ðŸ”„ Current Workflow

```bash
# Single command deployment
npm run publish:all
```

This command:
1. Builds the Vite app
2. Publishes to IPFS (gets new CID)
3. Updates Docker container
4. Makes site available on external IP immediately

## ðŸ“‹ Manual Steps (Only When Needed)

### Unstoppable Domains Update
1. Run deployment: `npm run publish:all`
2. Get CID: `cat latest-cid.txt`
3. Update UD dashboard with new CID
4. Wait 15-30 minutes for propagation

### IPFS Gateway Testing
```bash
# Local gateway (should always work)
curl http://localhost:8080/ipfs/$(cat latest-cid.txt)/

# External gateway (tests global availability)
curl -s "https://dweb.link/ipfs/$(cat latest-cid.txt)/" | head -5
```

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- [ ] Automated Unstoppable Domains updates (if API becomes available)
- [ ] Multiple IPFS pinning services for redundancy
- [ ] SSL certificate automation (Let's Encrypt)
- [ ] Monitoring/alerting for IPFS node health
- [ ] Geographic IPFS pinning for performance

### Development Tools
- [ ] Tailwind CSS re-integration (when v4 PostCSS issues resolved)
- [ ] Component library extraction
- [ ] Automated testing pipeline
- [ ] Performance monitoring

## ðŸ“Š Current Performance

- **Build Time**: ~1.84s
- **Bundle Size**: 277KB (87KB gzipped)
- **Deployment Time**: ~30s (full publish:all)
- **IPFS Propagation**: 5-15 minutes to global gateways
- **UD Propagation**: 15-30 minutes

## ðŸ”§ Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- **Monitor IPFS disk usage**: Check `/var/lib/ipfs/`
- **Update dependencies**: `npm audit` and updates
- **Docker cleanup**: `docker system prune` occasionally
- **Backup IPNS key**: Critical for domain control

### Health Checks
```bash
# IPFS status
ipfs swarm peers | wc -l  # Should show connected peers

# Container status  
docker ps  # Should show qube-brave-vite-app running

# nginx status
sudo systemctl status nginx  # Should be active
```

## ðŸ“… Migration History

**September 2025**: Next.js â†’ Vite migration completed
- Resolved IPFS CSS/routing issues
- Improved build performance
- Simplified deployment workflow
- Unified documentation

**Status**: All deployment goals achieved. System is production-ready and fully documented.
